A few notes about this font. It consists only of upper, and lower-case letters, 0-9, the period, comma, and hyphen. There is no kerning or spacing work done. Although most character forms are drawn to be visually similar to the Nokia Pure font designed by Dalton-Maag, they are *not* copies (they were not digitally copied, or manually traced) There are also deliberate changes made to the appearance of some of the characters. (for example, the bowl are veritcally flipped on various lowercase letters).
